# ArjunaCRM-Website

This is used for the marketing website (vedpragya.com).
This is not related in any way to the main app, which you can find in arjuna-front and arjuna-server.

## Getting Started

2. Run the migrations:

```bash
npx nx run arjuna-website:database:migrate
```

3. From the root directory:

```bash
npx nx run arjuna-website:dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
